# Foxy Subscription Alerts

Allows automatically sending messages for subscribers at specific configurable dates relative to the subscriptions `nextdate`.

## Usage

Sending alert emails can be as easy as creating a folder and some files.
All you need to do is to create a folder with the messages you want to send and within this folder create your email template.

Here is the simples example:

    - alerts/
        within-05/
            body.txt
            body.html

With this file structure in place, emails will be sent to users 5 days before their next subscription date. Also, the
messages will be sent in HTML (using the contents of the `.html` file) with a text fallback (with the contents of
the `.txt` file) for those users that for whatever reason cannot load the HTML message.


## Creating your email alerts

Each email alert is a folder within the `emails` folder.
Simply create these folders to create new email alerts. 

### Sensible defaults

There are some sensible defaults already put in place.
You can use them as they are or use them as inspiration to create your own email templates.

#### Naming your subscription alert folder
The way you name your folder will determine how it will be sent.

- **within** Name your folders `within-NUMBER` to send an alert mail about subscriptions with next_transaction_date withing NUMBER days.
- **past** Name your folders `past-NUMBER` to send an alert mail about subscriptions with next_transaction_date that occurred in NUMBER days in the past.

You can also restrict sending alerts only to `active` or `inactive` subscriptions. Prepend your folder with `active-` or `inactive-` to achieve this.

Here are some examples:

- `within-5`: sends alerts about subscriptions that will be renewed in 5 days.
- `past-12` : sends alerts about subscriptions expired 12 days ago.
- `inactive-past-2`: sends alerts about inactive subscriptions that expired 2 days ago.

#### Creating your files

You need to create at least one file in each folder, called `body.txt`, `body.html` or `body.mjml`.
The contents of this file will be the contents of your email.

You can also create a file called `subject.txt` to customize the subject of the message.

## Composing emails

You can compose your emails in plain text, HTML or MJML. If you don't provide a plain text version, one will be automatically created for you.

Pro tip: consider using MJML to send responsive emails that will look nice everywhere.

Note: all emails are related to a single subscription.

### Using variables

You can use the Twig templating language to compose your emails.

If you are not familiar with Twig, this might help:

- Variable substitution: use double curly braces to use a variable: `Hi {{ customer.first_name }}, please confirm your email is {{ customer.email }}`.
- Loop: use a "for loop" to display a list of things: `here are the products in your subscription: {% for item in items %} {{ item.name }} {% endfor %}`.

#### Available variables

Here are the variables you will have available when writing your email templates:

| Variable            | Description                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| customer            | Information about the customer related to the subscription.   |
| customer.first_name | the customer first name                                       |
| customer.last_name  | the customer last name                                        |
| customer.email      | the customer email                                            |
| items               | a list of items in the subscription (the original transaction)|
| items[0].name       | the name of the first item in the subscription.               |
| items[0].price      | the price of the first item in the subscription.              |
| start_date          | the start date of the subscription.                           |
| end_date            | the end date of the subscription.                             |
| frequency           | frequency of the subscription payments.                       |
| total               | The total payment for the original transaction.               |
| currency            | The currency of the original transaction.                     |

### Formatting your message

Composing HTML mail can be much harder than one would initially think. Knowing modern HTML and CSS can be misleading.
Building a consistent, responsive look and feel involves using many of the old practices from the pre tableless days.

[**mjml**](https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml) helps you build your templates using a markup language designed to handle these issues.
It also offers an [online editor](https://mjml.io/try-it-live) and a [desktop client](https://mjmlio.github.io/mjml-app/).
